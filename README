Clearing Project

On a good day this project can be run at https://rawgit.com/lucsan/clearing/master/clearing.html

You are standing in a clearing ...

The project take the classic early graphic adventure/RPC format and runs it straight in the browser.

No setup is required, simply dump the file stack on your drive and drag & drop clearing.html into your browser.

Developed on Chrome.

You can create specific run throughs (for testing) using runner.html and its controller app/tools/runner.js.

New things and places can be added in the app/data/things.js and app/data/places.js.

Default things actions (ie: look, pick up) are defined in app/components/thingsHandler.js.

The current direction of development is one of description over action.
